    "### Experience:\n",
    "2020 to now - **ESA Research Fellow** - European Space Research and Technology Centre, NL\n",
    "  -  Applying **Fourier Analysis**, **Gaussian Processes**, **Hierarchical Bayesian modelling** to **time-series data** using **PyMC3**, **Pyro**, **JAX**.\n",
    "  -  Providing statistical and scientific expertise to ESA staff scientists.\n",
    "  -  Designing, executing and disseminating novel research and its outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2020 - **Freelance Software Developer** - NumFOCUS, US\n",

    "### Projects:\n",
    "**Automated all-sky survey of stellar rotation in galactic structures**\n",
    "-  Built open source program automating measurement of stellar rotation in 213$\\,$GB of data.\n",
    "-  Built a hierarchical latent variable model reporting 790 stellar membership probabilities of galactic structures used for follow-up observations and analysis by scientific community.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced hierarchical models of stellar rotation in time-series data**\n",
    "-  Used hierarchical models, Gaussian processes to measure rotation in 94 stellar periodograms.\n",
    "-  Performed model rejection between two hypotheses in 5-dimensional parameter space, providing critical new evidence that a contested theory of stellar evolution was 98\\% more likely than its alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modelling covariances of stellar properties in large standard-candle populations**\n",
    "-  Developed generative hierarchical latent variable models of population of >5000 stars.\n",
    "-  Delivered detailed information about covariances in the population properties, leading to a 25\\% precision improvement of distance measurements calibrated using this population.\n",
